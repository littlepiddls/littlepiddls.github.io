## Solicitors Suck

I don’t like when people come to visit. 

## Solicitors Smell Bad

With in most cases solicitors are small children that try to sell me snacks and they usualy smell like a dead bird
## Just Say Goodbye

If a solicitor comes to your house hide or just open the door and say “goodbye.”
